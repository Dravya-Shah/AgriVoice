This project is to help the coffee farmers and the coffee plantations to identify, analyse and cure diseases of a coffee plant using a coffee leaf as the identification medium
It contains three main parts yoloV13 which is used to detect the disease of the plant leaf. The yolo model has been trained on the BRACOL dataset which contain's five class ["Cerospora", "Miner", "Phoma", "Rust", "Healthy"]
Then we use a Rag and LLM pipeline to create a chat-bot which answers the queries of the farmers and suggests cure to that particular disease before hand.
